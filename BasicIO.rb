# Ruby provides a whole set of I/O related methods in the Kernel module.
# A ruby module is like a Java interface.

# The print methods prints each paremeter its passed to standard out (stdout).
# It does not append a new line to the end of its output.
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"
print "cat", [1,2,3], 99, "\n"

# Observations: Arguments do not need to be enclosed in parenthesis,
# Delimeters like the semi-colon weren't needed at the end of the lines of code.
